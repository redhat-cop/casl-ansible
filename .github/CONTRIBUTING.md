# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. Here are a few ways you can help us improve.

## Open an Issue

If you see something you'd like changed, but aren't sure how to change it, submit an issue describing what you'd like to see.

## Submit a Pull Request

If you feel like getting your hands dirty, feel free to make the change yourself. Here's how:

1. Fork the repo on Github, and then clone it locally.
2. Create a branch named appropriately for the change you are going to make.
3. Make your code change.
4. Push your code change up to your forked repo.
5. Open a Pull Request to merge your changes to this repo. In order to make it easier for us to review your code, we would like each pull request to have a good description of the feature. Please copy paste the mardown below into the comment box in your PR and fill it out as appropriately as possible.

```markdown
#### What does this PR do?
Brief explanation of the code or documentation change you've made

#### How should this be manually tested?
Include commands to run your new feature, and also post-run commands to validate that it worked. (please use code blocks to format code samples)

#### Is there a relevant Issue open for this?
Provide a link to any open issues that describe the problem you are solving.

#### Who would you like to review this?
/cc @someone @someone_else
```
